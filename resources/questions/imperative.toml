# Item 1
[[questions]]
question = "Which statement best captures the core principle of the imperative paradigm?"
answer = "Programs specify a sequence of operations that change the program’s state."
alternatives = [
"Programs describe relationships between inputs and outputs.",
"Programs express computation as evaluation of mathematical functions.",
"Programs are composed of rules and logical inferences."
]

# Item 2
[[questions]]
question = "In imperative programming, what does state mutability imply?"
answer = "Variables can change values during execution, altering program state."
alternatives = [
"Variables can only be assigned once.",
"Functions must return new states instead of modifying existing ones.",
"The program cannot have side effects."
]

# Item 3
[[questions]]
question = "Which of the following correctly differentiates procedural programming from object-oriented programming under the imperative paradigm?"
answer = "Procedural organizes code into functions; OOP organizes code into classes and objects."
alternatives = [
"Procedural focuses on state, while OOP focuses on behavior.",
"Procedural uses classes, while OOP avoids them.",
"There is no difference; both are declarative."
]

# Item 4
[[questions]]
question = "What is a major drawback of the imperative approach compared to the declarative one?"
answer = "It requires explicitly managing control flow and state changes."
alternatives = [
"It is less efficient in execution.",
"It cannot handle user-defined data types.",
"It cannot perform recursion."
]

# Item 5
[[questions]]
question = "The statement 'The same operation performed in two different parts of an imperative program may produce different results' illustrates which property?"
answer = "Side effects"
alternatives = [
"Determinism",
"Immutability",
"Referential transparency"
]

# Item 6
[[questions]]
question = "What is a central idea behind logic programming as introduced in Lecture 8A?"
answer = "Computation is performed by stating facts and rules, and letting the system infer answers."
alternatives = [
"Programs explicitly list the step-by-step control flow.",
"All programs are purely functional, with no side effects.",
"Data and functions are merged into objects with methods."
]

# Item 7
[[questions]]
question = "In the context of logic programming, which of the following is not typically a component of a logic program?"
answer = "Explicit loops"
alternatives = [
"Facts",
"Rules",
"Queries"
]

# Item 8
[[questions]]
question = "The query system in logic programming works by:"
answer = "Matching queries against facts and attempting to satisfy conditions via backtracking."
alternatives = [
"Executing statements in a fixed sequence.",
"Translating logic programs to imperative machine code only.",
"Disallowing recursion to avoid infinite loops."
]

# Item 9
[[questions]]
question = "Which statement best captures the difference between logic programming and imperative programming?"
answer = "Logic programming separates what from how, while imperative programming tends to combine both."
alternatives = [
"Imperative programming uses facts and rules; logic programming uses assignments and loops.",
"Logic programming cannot express nondeterminism, while imperative can.",
"In logic programming, state mutation is the norm."
]

# Item 10
[[questions]]
question = "According to the lecture, logic programming systems often incorporate backtracking. Backtracking means:"
answer = "Reversing decisions when they lead to failure and trying alternative paths."
alternatives = [
"Progressing forward in a fixed linear order.",
"Caching previous results to speed up queries.",
"Disallowing recursion."
]
